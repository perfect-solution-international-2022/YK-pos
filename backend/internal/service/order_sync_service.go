Sync stores a batch of sales and returns one outcome per order, in the order

/*
ComputeTotals recomputes the sale independently of the client, returning
post-discount subtotal, tax, and grand total in cents.

Exported because it is the server's half of a two-sided contract, not a private
helper: it must agree to the cent with computeCartTotal on the till, and the
test that pins that agreement lives outside this package (test/service). A
mismatch here is not a crash — it silently flags honest sales for review — so
the parity test is the only thing that catches a drift, and it needs to be able
to call this.

This mirrors computeCartTotal in pos-frontend/src/lib/cart-math.ts step for
step, because any deviation would flag honest sales as mismatched and make the
flag worthless. In particular, matching the client means:

  - the raw subtotal accumulates unit_price * quantity as a float and is
    rounded once, after the whole cart, not per line; tax IS rounded per line;
  - line_discount_cents does not participate — the client tracks it per line
    but does not subtract it in the total, so neither does this;
  - the discount is clamped to that rounded subtotal, and tax is scaled by the
    resulting ratio rather than recomputed against the discounted base.

The client rounded the subtotal only on the way out of the transport before,
and clamped the discount against the unrounded figure, so a discounted
weighted sale could produce a tax ratio a cent away from this one. Both sides
now round at the same point.

Float arithmetic is deliberate here for the same reason: integer maths would
round differently from the client and produce spurious mismatches.
