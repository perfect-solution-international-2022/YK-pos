SyncOrderOutcome.Result carries one of four strings, matched by the client

part of the contract:

	already_synced - a previous push already stored it; also terminal success
	conflict       - rejected permanently, NEVER retried by the client
	error          - transient; the client retries on a later cycle

"conflict" strands the sale in the local database with no further attempt, so
it is reserved for a payload that can never succeed however often it is
resent. Anything that might work later must be "error".

The values themselves live on service.SyncOrderResult, which is what the
service produces and the handler stringifies; a duplicate set of constants
here was never referenced.

SyncOrdersResponse must carry exactly one outcome per submitted order,

An order the client sent but finds missing from results stays "syncing"
locally forever — nothing re-queues it, and only a page reload recovers it
(releaseOrphanedClaims on startup). That is a real data-loss path, so the
handler reports an outcome for every order even when handling one panics or
errors partway through the batch.
