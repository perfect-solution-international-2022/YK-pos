/*
Cents is an integer-cents money value that tolerates a fractional number on
the wire.

It exists because the client can send one. computeCartTotal
(pos-frontend/src/lib/cart-math.ts) multiplies unit_price_cents by a
fractional quantity for weighted items priced per kg, and it used not to round
the subtotal, so a 0.457 kg sale at 899 c/kg persisted and transmitted
total_cents: 410.843. A plain int64 field rejects that outright — and
encoding/json refuses even "410.0" — which would fail the whole sync batch
and strand every sale in it, including the well-formed ones.

The client now rounds, but this type stays: an offline till still holds
unsynced orders written by the older code, and those must remain syncable.

Rounding here rather than refusing is the safe direction: the sale already
happened at the till and the customer is holding a receipt. The recomputed
server total is recorded alongside the client's figures (see
orders.totals_mismatch), so the discrepancy stays visible instead of being
silently absorbed.
